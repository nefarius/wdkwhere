CLI tool that resolves Windows SDK installation paths.

## Motivation

> *This meeting could've been an email!*

And this tool could've been a shell script ðŸ˜… `wdkwhere` was inspired by [
`vswhere`](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere) but for locating
the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) installation folders instead.
The SDK hosts quite a few nifty everyday developer binaries like `signtool` which by default are not easily invokable on
the Terminal or in scripts since their respective directories are all not added to e.g. the `PATH` environment variable.

Granted, this could be somewhat automated via registry queries in PowerShell or even the CMD, or Python/VBS scripts and
alike, but why not use a nice language like C# and make it a dotnet tool instead!

## Installation

```PowerShell
dotnet tool install --global Nefarius.Tools.WDKWhere
```

## Usage examples

To display the help text and see all available flags run either
- `wdkwhere query --help` or
- `wdkwhere run --help` or
- `wdkwhere open --help`

### Basic usage

Calling `wdkwhere` without arguments simply returns the `bin` directory for the latest local WDK version and the current
operating system architecture (most likely `X64`):

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> wdkwhere
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Bin\10.0.22621.0\X64
PS C:\Users\Administrator>
```

### Advanced usage

You can also directly run applications shipped with the WDK by using the `run` verb; here's how to verify a PE file
signature with `signtool` and without having to deal with the installation path whatsoever:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Administrator> wdkwhere run signtool verify /pa /v C:\Windows\System32\consent.exe

Verifying: C:\Windows\System32\consent.exe

Signature Index: 0 (Primary Signature)
Hash of file (sha256): 829722E8F4EC6297337F26527AC4BB38D375605A0B36CF32988BDA0735ACF2C3

Signing Certificate Chain:
    ...truncated...

Successfully verified: C:\Windows\System32\consent.exe

Number of files successfully Verified: 1
Number of warnings: 0
Number of errors: 0
PS C:\Users\Administrator>
```

Both `stdout` and `stderr` of the invoked application are redirected to the current Terminal session and the exit code
of the `wdkwhere` process is set to the invoked command exit code, so behaviour in scripts is basically unaltered to
running the commands directly.
